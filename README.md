# 19 Bernard

## Requirements
We want to present the user with a 3D blog. 
The 3D blog will consist of a scene which is a simple hall with a door for each year that has come and pass starting from 2019.  
Behind each door will be 12 spheres, 1 for each month of the year.
On the inside walls of these spheres will be the blog posts.
The spheres will grow with posts.  
Users will have to sign up with their email. 
At the beginning, only my friends will have access to this blog.
If there is interest, this might be changed to accept non friends.

## Technicalities
 - SPA ReactJS served on Google app engine
 - 3D scene rendered with react-three-renderer
 - Bundled with ParcelJS
 - Application state managed with Redux
