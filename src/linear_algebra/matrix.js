/*
  1- Any finite set of vectors can be represented by a matrix with each column storing the coordinates of the vectors.
  2- A 3D basis is a set of 3 vectors that serves as space coordinates reference point.
  (ex: the standard basis is v1(1,0,0), v2(0,1,0), v3(0,0,1))
  3- If we want to change any vector's coordinates to a new basis, we only need to left-multiply its components by the
     inverse of this new basis matrix.
  4- wtf is a quaterion?
  5- a quaternion is the key to everything
